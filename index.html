            ><em> Kour.io</em> is a fast-paced 3D first-person shooter where
            players compete in team-based battles across different maps. Each
            player chooses from various classes, each with its own strengths and
            abilities. The goal is to work with your team to outsmart and
            outshoot the opposing team. Players can earn rewards by completing
            challenges, which can then be used to unlock new skins and other
            customizations for their character. In addition to standard
            gameplay, Kour.io allows players to create their own maps and game
            modes, adding a lot of variety to how the game is played. You can
            also join or create clans to play with friends and adjust settings
            to match your preferred style of play.</strong

            ><em>Minecraft</em> is a sandbox game where players explore and
            modify a world made of blocks, engaging in activities like building,
            mining, crafting, and battling mobs. The game features redstone
            circuits for automation, minecarts for transportation, and
            dimensions like the Nether and the End, the latter offering a final
            challenge with the Ender Dragon. Developed by Markus "Notch" Persson
            and later expanded by Mojang Studios, Minecraft's open-ended design
            supports both single-player and multiplayer experiences, fostering
            creativity and collaboration.</strong

            ><em>Roblox</em> is an online platform that allows users to create,
            share, and play games, known as experiences, across various genres.
            Using the Lua programming language, players can design their own
            worlds, customize avatars, and interact with others in a highly
            social environment. The platform supports everything from obstacle
            courses and role-playing games to simulations and first-person
            shooters. Released in 2006 by Roblox Corporation, founded by David
            Baszucki and Erik Cassel, Roblox has grown into one of the most
            popular gaming platforms, with over 164 million monthly users as of
            2020. Its expansion was fueled by user-generated content, a virtual
            economy, and a surge in popularity during the COVID-19
            pandemic.</strong
